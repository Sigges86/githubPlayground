# **GitHub Playground**

Welcome, my brothers Isak and Daniel! ðŸ‘‹  

This project is a playground for us to learn **IT development** and explore how **testing** fits into the process. Weâ€™ll focus on the basics of **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**, and introduce **TypeScript** for automated testing.  

### **Why is this important?**  
- **HTML** helps us build the structure of web pages.  
- **CSS** makes web pages look good.  
- **JavaScript** adds interactivity to websites.  
- **TypeScript** and **Playwright** help us write automated tests, which is a very valuable skill in IT right now.  

This guide will walk you step-by-step so you can set everything up and start coding ðŸš€.

## **Step 1: Install Git**  

We use **Git** to manage and save changes to the code. It keeps track of every version of the code so we can work together without losing anything.  

### **How to Install Git:**  
1. Go to the official Git website: [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/).  
2. Download Git for your operating system (Windows, Mac, or Linux).  
3. Install it by following the on-screen instructions.  

### **Verify Git Installation:**  
Open a terminal (Command Prompt, Powershell, or any terminal tool) and type:  
```bash
git --version
